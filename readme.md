## Requirement

Since KodeKloud courses are not free, you must be a subscriber. After activating your account as a subscriber, use this extension to download any course you want.

## Installation

This extension is not available on Chrome Web Store because developers must pay 5 Euros to verify their developer account and here in Iran, 5 euros is a high rate so I didn't pay for it! You can do the same, go free and use this extension in developer mode:

- Download and extract this repository into a directory
- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable `Developer Mode` on the top right corner
- Click on `"Load unpacked"`
- Select the directory that you created in the first step
- Click Extensions icon in menu bar, pin KodeKloud Downloader if it's not showing in menu bar
