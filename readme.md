# KodeKloud Downloader Chrome Extension

With this extension, you can download any KodeKloud course. It extracts direct links from website and let you download the course videos.

## Requirement

Since KodeKloud courses are not free, you must be a subscriber. After activating your account as a subscriber, use this extension to download any course you want.

## Installation

This extension is not available on Chrome Web Store because developers must pay 5 Euros to verify their developer account and here in Iran, 5 euros is a high rate so I didn't pay for it! You can do the same, go free and use this extension in developer mode:

- Download and extract this repository into a directory
- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable `Developer Mode` on the top right corner
- Click on `"Load unpacked"`
- Select the directory that you created in the first step
- You are good to go!

## Usage

Visit any lecture of any course in KodeKloud website, wait untile the page loading is finished and then click on the extension icon. A text file will be downloaded which contains all letures download url.

## Donate

Maybe someday or somewhere, you buy me a beer, who knows?!
